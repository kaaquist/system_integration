The txt file has to include these three lines, like so:
 
Class:
Responsibility:
Collaboration:

Add responsibilities and collaborations to the lines, separating each "event/action" 
using this delimiter ; (semicolon).

After the file is done it is then possible to generate a tex file using the crc_to_tex.py
