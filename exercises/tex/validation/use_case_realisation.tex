\section{Use Case Realisation}
\label{sec:usecaserealisation}
In this section, we provide sequence diagrams showing how the scenario of Trade, including alternative and exceptional scenario, are realised with the design described above.

\begin{myfigure}{TradeSuccessful}{.9}%
	\caption{Sequence diagram for Trade is Successful}
	\label{fig:state-machine-server}
\end{myfigure}

This diagram shows the sequence for a successful Trade between two characters.

\begin{myfigure}{TradeDeclined}{.9}%
	\caption{Sequence diagram for Trade is Declined}
	\label{fig:state-machine-server}
\end{myfigure}

This diagram shows the sequence for a declined trade by the character that is asked to trade. 

\begin{myfigure}{TradeCounter}{.9}%
	\caption{Sequence diagram for Trade with Counter trade}
	\label{fig:state-machine-server}
\end{myfigure}

This diagram shows the sequence for a decline of the counter offer that the approached character has offered.
