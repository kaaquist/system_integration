This chapter will outline the design of the Mud Game. We will provide a rough system design using CRC cards to describe the detailed use cases mentioned in the above section about \emph{Detailed Use Cases~\ref{sec:detailedusecases}}. We will also provide a component design alongside state machines outlining the protocols used to communicate between the components. Finally we will provide a detailed Class diagram and behaviour diagrams of the flow in the program.
