\section{Rough System Design}
%Use CRC cards to create a rough design of the system. Base your CRC cards session on the use cases you have detailed in the last exercise.
In this section we use CRC cards to give a rough design of the system. The CRC cards are focusing on the three detailed Use Cases mentioned in the \emph{Detailed Use Cases~\ref{sec:detailedusecases}} section. Each CRC card show the responsibilities for the Classes we intended to have in our \emph{Detaile Class Design~\ref{sec:detailedclassdesign}}. The CRC card are also showing the collaborating classes. \newline \newline
