%Scope: the system under design
%\addfield{Scope:}{System-wide}

%Level: "user-goal" or "subfunction"
\addfield{Description:}{A driver wants to check-out his vehicle using a toll tag.}

%Primary Actor: Calls on the system to deliver its services.
\addfield{Actor:}{Driver, Cashier}

%Stakeholders and Interests: Who cares about this use case and what do they want?
%\additemizedfield{Stakeholders and Interests:}{
%	\item Stakeholder 1 name: his interests

%Preconditions: What must be true on start and worth telling the reader?
\addfield{Preconditions:}{The driver has a toll tag in his vehicle.}
%when multiple
%\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{} 

%Main Success Scenario: A typical, unconditional happy path scenario of success.
\addscenario{Main Scenario:}{
	\item The driver approaches a toll lane with an antenna.
	\item The toll lane antenna recognises the toll tag.
	\item The toll lane reports the check-out to the toll station.
	\item The toll station replies with a check-out success.
	\item The toll lane lifts the barrier and the driver exits the motorway.
}

%Extensions: Alternate scenarios of success or failure.
\addscenario{Alternative Scenario:}{
	\item[2.a] The antenna does not recognise the toll tag:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[1.] The check-out fails and a cashier is summoned.
		\item[2.] The cashier resolves the issue as it sees fit.
		\item[3.] Go to Main Scenario step 5. 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item[4.a] The toll station replies with check-out failure.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[1.] The check-out fails and a cashier is summoned.
		\item[2.] The cashier resolves the issue as it sees fit.
