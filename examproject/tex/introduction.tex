We have tried to work with an agile approach in this project. First we made a component diagram and a domain diagram and to tried to look at the business processes mentioned in the project description, this was done as an attempt to understand the project as a whole. After this was done we focused on the use cases that could cover the business processes in the project. We ordered them by importance and assigned them to development pairs that worked with one of the functionalities each (as we are an odd number, this was not done strictly as pairs).

We have used domain-driven design as an approach to break the task down into manageable tasks/functionalities that could be developed independently without having to complete the project with a waterfall process.
 
For the class diagram and object life cycle state machines we did exploratory modelling. Not explicitly with CRC cards, but by acting as classes while drawing diagrams and refactoring before creating final diagrams.

During the development phase we have come back to the parts we have modelled and corrected the design if we have changed it on another level in the domain. We have also done reviews in teams of cross-cutting concepts.
