\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project we have gotten some valuable experience. When multiple people model many aspects of the same system, consistency becomes a major issue. Using the correct tool can help some of the way, but it still requires discipline from all participants to keep things consistent. When the tool is also unable to merge changes, further care must be taken. We decided to have a physical lock in the form of a hat when the group was gathered and use social media to claim the resource when working apart.

Working on models in a pair helps a lot to get something good done, as someone to spar with can help explore the possibilities better. Reviewing the model with the whole team present looking at the same screen, e.g. with a beamer can help find some of the more sneaky mistakes.
